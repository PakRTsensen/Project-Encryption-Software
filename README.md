### Project Encryption Software

#### Project Objective
The primary aim of this project is to significantly enhance an existing encryption software by expanding its features and ensuring compatibility across a wide array of operating systems and devices. The key objectives include:

#### 1. Integration of Enhanced Encryption Features
The project focuses on integrating advanced encryption features, including the implementation of an encrypted texts functionality. This will leverage the robust algorithms present in Veracrypt, ensuring secure communication channels while utilizing established encryption techniques.

#### 2. Implementation of 'Authorized Device' Security Feature
An essential aspect of this project involves introducing an 'Authorized Device' security feature during the setup phase of drives or storage. Users will have the flexibility to select their preferred authentication methodâ€”be it a password, file-based key, or authorized device. The 'Authorized Device' feature allows access only to devices authorized for decryption, significantly mitigating the risks associated with brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts.
